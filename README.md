You can perform your cloud deployments using this bot.

You can say something like

***I would like to deploy EC2 machines of t2.micro having ubuntu using key sameer***

and achieve one utterance deployment! Or you can interact with the bot specifying values for each parameter as you are prompted, until it gathers all values and launches the deployment.
